No really big gains until Instutional and Money Manager want it to.

HardleyStanley,1611092,324125269,"@JoeyGGGG @europoor @Cryptospark @FiestyP @matt0099 Lol. There’s literally no comparison between STEM and CLSK. Seriously, especially at CLSK current price. Clsk is the better pick, by FAR. Hell, even if they were the same market cap, clsk is still the better pick, financially.

First of all, so many people spout “10x revenue” or hell 20 p/s as if any stock can easily trade at that level.
Do you understand how pricey 10-20x revenue even is?
This is the average of the SOFTWARE industry with average margins at 90%. 
STEM currently only has 12% margins and plans 40% by 2026.

CLSK FY2022(From September 30)) EBITDA margins are projected around 60-70% approximately 50% higher than STEM’s PROFIT MARGINS.

Before the latest mining rig orders, we were already 1 year ahead in terms of profitability but 1 year behind on revenue. But due to the orders, we’re now 2 years ahead with similarish revenues with a fraction the price.",N/A,N/A,"5/3/21, 01:34 PM"

Customer 1, 55K price leased at 600 per month with 3k down for 24 months. = 17.4k 
Customer 2, 500 per month with 3k down for 24 months = 15k

Customer 5, 350 per month with 3k down for 24 months = 11.4k 
Customer 6, purchases the Ocean for 18k  
Remember, this model gets serviced and maintained during this time, so it always has a warranty. 
This is 86.4K over the life of the Ocean. Now, how much to maintain it? Let's use 12%. So 86.4k x 12% = 76K revenue on a 55k Ocean.

However dear ol' AA fucked them up announcing no share dilution so they returned said loaned shares and are returning more because they were paying interest on shares that are now not going to be used for the attack...

Sykes,873468,324114263,$BYND last er they said Q1 not going to be great.  And most things were still shut down in Q1.  Reopening didn’t kick in till end of April and most things will be opening up in the summer.  So I’m not expecting anything great here but it’s all about what’s yet to come towards the end of the year.   I know it’s unlikely they will give guidance but I hope they give some clarity into the deals and how things are lining up for Q2.   Hope they don’t just release a new Pepsi product and leave it at that.  I’m gonna be holding through this earnings despite whatever the outcome may be and expecting some volatility.   JMO.,$BYND,N/A,12:56 PM
jaechung1992,784674,324127663,@Sykes i’m not expecting anything great Q1 either but so is the market. My guess is details on Pepsi and maybe partnership with KFC on Beyond Chicken. The fact that the new version came out a week before earnings kind of worries me for some reason. Hope i am wrong.,N/A,N/A,56m
Sykes,873468,324136965,@jaechung1992 I think estimates are still high for Q1. Also last to er it was near 200 and halved but this time we are going into er already being halved so yes it’s kinda scary.   But I think if the goal is to hold long term then it will most likely recover and pay handsomely.,N/A,N/A,43m

Charles_S_Peirce,4702401,323463875,@rmtt @WaspompingJimblows Thank you for getting back. I did not mean that remark as a slight. I was just letting Waspo know that I tried. It is  apparent that you work hard on being a valued and trusted person here. I appreciate that. I have done a lot of reading and followed thru w/ the DD pack that you conveniently condensed into one spot. It’s sounds promising. I’ve already upped my position to 5k shares. Also… I understand about social media even though I do not use it. Other than ST & linkedIn (which my company requires) I use none. Ive also never “cross tagged” as far as I’m aware. If I did.. it was unintentional or for reference.  Anyway… Thank you for your stewardship on the stock manipulation.  I will continue to follow your work. Thx again!,N/A,N/A,"5/3/21, 01:11 PM"

I am the same as you....I don't use SM.....I read sometimes...but I don't post. I only post here...and then I am a member of some car forums and some weight lifting forums I post on and help out where I can. 
 
The cross tag remark was just to give you a heads up....used to be you could cross tag other tickers...but now people are getting suspended for it....just didn't want you to have that situation. 
 
It's actually sad as you can find a lot of good plays that way.....I always would look at what someone posted...and do my own research as usual. 
 
To me the risk/reward ratio here is to great. Even if not for the squeeze we are waiting for....I think it's a solid company overall. The NFT collab proves that! Good Luck.",N/A,N/A,"5/3/21, 01:38 PM"

Clsk is the better pick, by FAR. Hell, even if they were the same market cap, clsk is still the better pick, financially.

First of all, so many people spout “10x revenue” or hell 20 p/s as if any stock can easily trade at that level.
Do you understand how pricey 10-20x revenue even is?
This is the average of the SOFTWARE industry with average margins at 90%. 
STEM currently only has 12% margins and plans 40% by 2026.

CLSK FY2022(From September 30)) EBITDA margins are projected around 60-70% approximately 50% higher than STEM’s PROFIT MARGINS.

Before the latest mining rig orders, we were already 1 year ahead in terms of profitability but 1 year behind on revenue. But due to the orders, we’re now 2 years ahead with similarish revenues with a fraction the price.",N/A,N/A,46m

The rich: cut a check and pay for the best school. Pay for grades. Do not work. And are given a company when they graduate.

The poor mans/woman’s company is in competition with the rich. Rich boy/girl has their heggie friends to short the poor company into oblivion to eliminate the rich’s competition. The 1% maintains their generational wealth.

Likely they are trying to finalize something to make earnings more impactful and cant talk about it yet.  Only reason to risk doing something like this imo.  My thinking is it stays in this consolidation pattern until earnings.  These patterns tighten until a catalyst provides a breakout up or down, typically up on previously bullish stocks.  I just dont see there being enough sellers or buyers to break out of pattern until earnings. So more the same although even less volitility and tighter trading range if they dont release news or earnings monday.  This is a chart waiting on catalyst.

3dBm,3420730,322182215,"@JETattoos @3dBm also (ran into word count)... 

That call, what was your takeaway? Do you listen to tone of voice and the way people say things? I pay attention to stuff like that, a lot. The energy in the room was much different, the tone of Summit's voice, the care of words he used (came across as concise and scripted) and the emotional energy (dampened or attenuated/non-emotional). Was all so different than our last call. I felt like the last call he was excited and almost jumping out of his chair, this call he was measured and controlled.

My takeaway, Summit has received some advisement and coaching from someone... to help him have a better public poker face. I believe a deal is close and he was being very careful to walk a line, making sure to not step over any part of it that might give away a clue or anger a bidder. 

Did you pick up on any of that, if so, did you have any thoughts about it? Always a pleasure Jack, you are one of two people on here that I genuinely enjoy",N/A,N/A,"4/30/21, 02:37 AM"

I feel there’s a reason he was frustrated and almost kept to a crawl with his words. You know how passionate SS is and I feel like he was splitting at the seems trying not to correct moronic questions and claims. Especially after kicking ass on completing a terrific milestone and doing so in such a fast forwarded manner. I think we are nearing big partnerships or buyout everyday.

Clsk is the better pick, by FAR. Hell, even if they were the same market cap, clsk is still the better pick, financially.

First of all, so many people spout “10x revenue” or hell 20 p/s as if any stock can easily trade at that level.
Do you understand how pricey 10-20x revenue even is?
This is the average of the SOFTWARE industry with average margins at 90%. 
STEM currently only has 12% margins and plans 40% by 2026.

CLSK FY2022(From September 30)) EBITDA margins are projected around 60-70% approximately 50% higher than STEM’s PROFIT MARGINS.

Before the latest mining rig orders, we were already 1 year ahead in terms of profitability but 1 year behind on revenue. But due to the orders, we’re now 2 years ahead with similarish revenues with a fraction the price.",N/A,N/A,"5/3/21, 01:34 PM"

One small question "" what is a douche bag"" pray tell?? 
I clicked onto the POS one, admittedly that was rather easy! I don't really swear as a rule and now it tends to come out in Spanish which is rather entertaining as when I am in England I can get away with being rude and not thumped on the nose 😂🤣😆

I presume that this other chappie was on our conversation... Sorry about that. 
Shall we use the private chat system instead?
I don't wish to cause any upheaval or that we have other similar incidents... 

Woke up to find that the figures have gone up enormously and not in my favour, however, I am feeling pretty positive that we will pullback slowly but surely so lets soldier on!!

Just buy literally as much of this stock in your IRAs as you can, set your monthly dividends to DRIP, shut up and forget about it until you are 67.5 years old, be a millionaire. If you own (or moronically trade) this in your regular, non-retirement accounts you're an idiot who loves to pay taxes.  
 
Who cares about anything else? Earnings, technicals, and fundamentals are irrelevant, especially now that we know they were able to collect ~97% of their rent during a global pandemic and a nationwide shutdown. If the stock falls your DRIP buys you even more shares. Its a REIT. It has to pay you no matter what. And they've been doing it for 610 straight months. Longer than most of us have been alive. Not to mention increasing payout for the last 25 years!

Clinical studies:

A Phase II trial of VXA-CoV2-1, our vaccine encoding both the S and the N proteins, is expected to start mid-year 2021 instead of 2Q. The delay is due to manufacturing issues at the Baltimore contract manufacturing facility, the same facility where other COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers have also reported issues.

Manufacturing of our vaccines is currently underway at the Company’s other manufacturing partner, and at our own GMP facility. We are also evaluating additional manufacturing partners both in the U.S. and abroad.

Phase I/II studies of two S-only vaccine constructs targeting different variants are planned to begin in 3Q 2021.

Boosting studies with previously vaccinated or infected subjects are also planned for 2H 2021.

I was really hoping for another online betting/gambling biz from these three so to say the least I’m extremely disappointed with this merger. This reminds me a lot of ONVO which was, and still has been, stagnant a long time. (And yes, I know they are not the same company, so you don’t need to yell at me.)

While Ginkgo company is doing exciting stuff, it’s going to take a LONG time for it to go anywhere. I don’t want to wait, so I’m moving on to faster growers.

I’m not emotionally attached to any of these and I don’t like it when my money sits around and does nothing.  Price action makes me money, not “hopes and dreams.” I don’t care what kind of “widgets” they make.

be giving it away soon - as announced by the White House.  There simply will be no demand in the USA for a new  less effective overseas vaccine, even if the FDA were to miraculously approve it without a US P3 trial.  Finally, Bharat cannot be sending Covaxin to the USA while India is in crisis.  So problems include no supply, no demand, and almost zero likelihood of approval in 2021.

That’s just the last day people can buy and will be able to receive the dividend once it does come to the market. Now if you buy before June 30 and sell before the IPO is released then you will not receive the free shares. I just want to make sure everyone understands that I can already here the complaining about how they didn’t receive free shares June 30, 2021. That should be a good question for Henry in the next conference call about when American Pacific Resources IPO will be released unless anyone else has some better knowledge on it? Also it’s a 20:1 dividend so for every 20 shares of PHIL you own you will receive 1 free share of American Pacific Resources IPO when it is released. Here is the SEC filing.

Dodiemcclain23,3260119,324142478,"$SKLZ Eagle Eye actually does a great job of bringing the issue of bonus cash to the forefront. Looking into this, some might believe Skillz's management is being sneaky or even doing something illegal -- that goes too far, in my opinion. However, at least a portion of the company's revenue comes from bonus cash, meaning it doesn't represent the real money being deposited onto the platform. That's an issue worth discussing, and I handle the possible implications in another article.

In the end, I believe we should all be looking for opinions that disagree with our own. It's why I read the short reports on Skillz stock even though I own shares. If there's validity to their arguments, I win, because now I understand the risks better than I did before. But if their arguments don't hold water, I also win, because my conviction strengthens.

Wiffle1,2243047,323990287,"$AMRS A few days ago I speculated that the third deal will be related to sweeteners. Of particular interest to me is the breadth of the deal, specifically if targeted “collaboration molecules” extend beyond rebaudiosides. With the target yield of RebM achieved, manufacturing of RebM could be the centerpiece. However, I would also like to see that Amyris intends to capture even more of the sweetener market. Mogrosides (monk fruit) and “rare sugars” such as psicose and tagatose would be a few interesting ones. 

With this said, I have been keeping an eye on the other players in the space, and Ginkgo recently disclosed a patent filing for the monk fruit sweetener core mogrol. This definitively links them to the lucrative sweetener market, too. It’s interesting that they are pursuing mogrol and not steviol, suggesting they may be trying to avoid direct competition with Amyris’ RebM.

Lots of moving pieces, I suspect we’ll get some clarity this week...can’t wait.

Shares available is shrinking daily also as big money buys in from what data shows so far this year.   Setting up for epic run imo as long as they deliver on the production by end of this year.  NIO will 80k-100k units this year and is valued at $50 billion (this will be there 1st year making this many vehicles).  If $RIDE can do 50,000 next year, then at same valuation it would be $300/share.  I say cut that by 2/3 and that is $100/share and seems doable by end of 2022 if stars align.

Manufacturing of our vaccines is currently underway at the Company’s other manufacturing partner, and at our own GMP facility. We are also evaluating additional manufacturing partners both in the U.S. and abroad.
Phase I/II studies of two S-only vaccine constructs targeting different variants are planned to begin in 3Q 2021.

That said, price is selling now.  Not tomorrow or sometime in the future, it's doing so now.

That narrative can change on a dime though and if that happens then we React to the change and adapt accordingly.

Something everyone needs to know is that the OTC is chalk full of bad stocks in and around trips. A few months ago there was a lot of money flowing into the OTC which gave the illusion that there weren’t as many bad stocks as there actually is. There’s so much unknown to the OTC that many times what initially appears as a bad stock can actually be a gem. However, we need to be making efforts to sift out the bad eggs as best we can if we really want to maximize our portfolio.

I’m all about buying stocks when everyone is either too afraid or the stock isn’t widely known about yet. But there’s a difference between buying a stock when no one else is, and buying a stock that no one should. This is why DD goes a long way in the OTC.",N/A,N/A,01:23 PM

Looking into this, some might believe Skillz's management is being sneaky or even doing something illegal -- that goes too far, in my opinion. However, at least a portion of the company's revenue comes from bonus cash, meaning it doesn't represent the real money being deposited onto the platform. That's an issue worth discussing, and I handle the possible implications in another article.

In the end, I believe we should all be looking for opinions that disagree with our own. It's why I read the short reports on Skillz stock even though I own shares. If there's validity to their arguments, I win, because now I understand the risks better than I did before. But if their arguments don't hold water, I also win, because my conviction strengthens.

Excerpt from MDGL: 
“This may help to explain the FDA / EMA's tough approval stance, and also Madrigal's high cash burn - in the first nine months of last year, the company burnt through $147m of cash, making a net loss of $143m - most likely related to the number of liver biopsies and other diagnostic and biomarker tests the company is paying for, in order to select appropriate patients for its trials.”",$LPCN,Bullish,"5/1/21, 10:20 PM"

Likely they are trying to finalize something to make earnings more impactful and cant talk about it yet.  Only reason to risk doing something like this imo.  My thinking is it stays in this consolidation pattern until earnings.  These patterns tighten until a catalyst provides a breakout up or down, typically up on previously bullish stocks.  I just dont see there being enough sellers or buyers to break out of pattern until earnings. So more the same although even less volitility and tighter trading range if they dont release news or earnings monday.  This is a chart waiting on catalyst.

Shares available is shrinking daily also as big money buys in from what data shows so far this year.   Setting up for epic run imo as long as they deliver on the production by end of this year.  NIO will 80k-100k units this year and is valued at $50 billion (this will be there 1st year making this many vehicles).  If $RIDE can do 50,000 next year, then at same valuation it would be $300/share.  I say cut that by 2/3 and that is $100/share and seems doable by end of 2022 if stars align.

Something everyone needs to know is that the OTC is chalk full of bad stocks in and around trips. A few months ago there was a lot of money flowing into the OTC which gave the illusion that there weren’t as many bad stocks as there actually is. There’s so much unknown to the OTC that many times what initially appears as a bad stock can actually be a gem. However, we need to be making efforts to sift out the bad eggs as best we can if we really want to maximize our portfolio.

I’m all about buying stocks when everyone is either too afraid or the stock isn’t widely known about yet. But there’s a difference between buying a stock when no one else is, and buying a stock that no one should. This is why DD goes a long way in the OTC.",$HAON,N/A,01:23 PM

I’d suggest doing more DD into bitcoin too.
Also bitcoin miners get better returns than bitcoin itself, except for clsk recently which is why it’s the most undervalued of the top miners by a factor of 2.
AND clsk has the added benefit of being able to invest bitcoin profits into their energy division or acquire more companies.

Also, STEM is currently trading about 17X EV/EBITDA for FY2024 at CURRENT prices.

TL;DR  trading is f*cking hard

The following applies to my trading style (futures day trading/weekly SPX options/buying shares for swings):

predicting price moves is exhausting and leads to losses

Reacting to price in real time and adapting to the movement leads me to profits.

predicting is easy for me, and I feel comfy when I feel confident in my prediction.

Reacting to price in real time is terrifying.  This doesn't much apply to me when positioning shares for a swing.  That's a rather easy play for me.  With weekly SPX options and especially day trading futures contracts reacting to price in real time very challenging.  The options premium can change abruptly.  Same with the futures.  If price goes against me at all I need scratch the trade and get out else I could wind up with big losses.  It's just... for me it's high intensity trading.  The reason it terrifies me is because I know how easily I can lose a lot of money quickly.  Mistakes are very costly.",$SPY,N/A,"5/1/21, 06:23 PM"
Roth_Trader,1323307,323739639,"@Craziness95  fear, it produces doubt which leads to inaction.  For me, taking action in trading is exactly what you mentioned, just doing the damn thing.  It can be very uncomfortable.  But I now identify that the uncomfortable feelings are a proof that I am growing.  I'm super comfy when I'm being a lazy sack of sh*t and not doing anything  lol def super comfy then 😉

this all reminded me of a Joe Rogan sound clip I heard years ago.  ""One of the worst decisions a man can make is to be comfortable.  I don't think you should try to be comfortable.  I think what you should try and do is earn comfort.""  I couldn't find a link to the clip, but found this one which gives the same sort of message:

Australia approval which should be accelerated after the FDA approval. 4.

$PCG had ER last thursday and $XLU moving back up as people still like that sector for safety?  

As long as there are no fires for a few months might be a good trade.

Wells Fargo upgraded PG&E to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $15.50, up from $12. Following the year-to-date 15% underperformance versus the S&P Utilities index, PG&E's risk/reward ""looks highly compelling,"" Kalton tells investors in a research note. Wildfire risk remains a constant threat for the company and bankruptcy risk, while remote, ""continues to lurk in the background,"" says the analyst. That being said, Kalton thinks the combination of the AB 1054 liability cap, substantial mitigation efforts employed by PG&E and California's improved firefighting techniques ""meaningfully reduce the risk to investors."" The analyst sees a ""tactical opportunity"" following the recent stock weakness.",N/A,N/A,"5/3/21, 01:48 PM"

On the flip side- A sample, plenty of new institutes have invested last week around these levels and higher, not everyone feels this will go all the way back to ten, and there are a lot of catalysts that can send this screaming upward. I think FUD has been overused and seeking alpha articles really are chuckle worthy. But 🤷🏼‍♂️ short term who ever really knows with this company.

What is a SEC Form 424B2?
This is the most recent filing for OEG and is a Prospectus filed when making a primary offering of securities on a delayed basis.

They first started the process back on February 3 with the original registration for the 150 mil shelf offering.
Then on April 6 they filed an amendment to delay that registration. Now this seems to be the last leg of the process for the original shelf offering and to the best of my knowledge they are now all set up and legal to do an offering when the time comes. 

So the next couple of questions are... When will they do the offering and how will it affect the share price?

While no one really knows the exact answers to these questions we can look at the past offerings and come up with an educated guess.
